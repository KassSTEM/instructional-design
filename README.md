# Instructional Design Example
Welcome!

Here you will find an example instructional design project created using [Articulate's Rise 360 online course authoring software](https://www.articulate.com/360/rise/).

To do this yourself, you will need to:

1. Download the zipped file from Rise 360 (use the "publish" button in edit mode and select "web")
2. Unzip the file (this creates a folder called "content")
3. Create a new repository on your Github account
4. Upload everything inside the "content" folder to the new repository
5. Deploy to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
